- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Style**: RESTful API endpoints
- **Middleware**: Custom logging, JSON parsing, and error handling
- **Development**: Hot reload with tsx for TypeScript execution

### Data Layer

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users fill out the application form on the landing page
2. **Form Submission**: Form data is validated client-side using Zod schemas
3. **API Request**: TanStack Query handles the POST request to `/api/applications`
4. **Server Processing**: Express.js validates the data and stores it using the storage layer
5. **Response Handling**: Success/error feedback displayed via toast notifications
6. **Admin Access**: Applications can be retrieved via GET endpoint for administrative purposes

## External Dependencies

- **Hot Reload**: Vite handles frontend hot reload, tsx handles backend reload
- **Database**: Uses in-memory storage for development, can be switched to PostgreSQL

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds static assets to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Deployment**: Configured for Replit's autoscale deployment target
- **Environment**: Production mode with optimized builds and proper error handling
